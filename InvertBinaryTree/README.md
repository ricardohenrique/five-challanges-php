Invert Binary Tree
------------------

The task is to invert a binary tree, so the leaf's order is inverted.

Example:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```
inverts to:
```
        1
       / \
      3   2
     / \ / \
    7  6 5  4
```

Please verify your result by running in this directory `./phpunit.phar .`

Note: keep in mind that a tree can also be imbalanced.
