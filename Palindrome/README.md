Palindrome
----------

A palindrome is a word, or senctance that reads the same backward or forward.

Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored. Whitespaces should also be ignored. 

For example: `isPalindrome('Deleveled')` should return true as character case should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.
